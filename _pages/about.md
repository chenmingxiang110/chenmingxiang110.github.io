# Hi there, I’m Mingxiang!

I’m a Computer Vision Engineer at Ant Group, located in Hangzhou, China. Prior to that, I was a deep learning algorithm engineer at Realsee (formerly Ke Holdings Inc), playing with floorplan recognition, AI interior design, speech recognition, and many other stuff.

I got my master degree from Stanford University. I'm currently focusing on developing machine learning and other data-driven approaches to enable 3D model generation and texturization.
